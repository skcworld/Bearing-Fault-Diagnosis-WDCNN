# Bearing-Fault-Diagnosis-WDCNN
This repository contains the implementation of **WDCNN (Wide Deep Convolutional Neural Network)** for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery using time-series data.

## Dataset

The model is trained and evaluated on the dataset from the following paper:

> **Vibration, acoustic, temperature, and motor current dataset of rotating machine under varying operating conditions for fault diagnosis**  
> *Data in Brief, Volume 48, 2023, 109049*  
> [DOI: 10.1016/j.dib.2023.109049](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2023.109049)
 
- Total classes: **11** (including multiple fault types and healthy condition)

## Result

Final classification result:
